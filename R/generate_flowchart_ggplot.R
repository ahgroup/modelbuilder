#' @title This function takes as input a modelbuilder model and creates a diagram using ggplot
#'
#' @description The model needs to adhere to the structure specified by the modelbuilder package
#' models built using the modelbuilder package automatically have the right structure
#' a user can also build a model list structure themselves following the specifications
#' if the user provides an Rdata file name, this file needs to contain an object called 'model'
#' and contain a valid modelbuilder model structure
#' @param model model structure, either as list object or Rdata file name
#' @return The function returns the diagram stored in a variable
