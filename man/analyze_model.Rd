\title{A function that analyzes a modelbuilder model object.}
\usage{
analyze_model(modelsettings, mbmodel)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelsettings}{a list of model settings:
\itemize{
\item modeltype : A string indicating the type of model. Accepted values are "ode", "stochastic", and "discrete".
\item rngseed : A random number seed for the simulation.
\item nreps : Number of times to run the simulation.
\item plotscale : Log or linear scale for the x-axis, y-axis, or both.
\item vars : named vector of initial conditions for variables
\item pars : named vector of initial conditions for parameters
\item times : named vector of values for tstart, tfinal, dt
}}

\item{mbmodel}{A modelbuilder model object.}
}
\value{
A list named "result" with each simulation and associated metadata as a sub-list.
}
\description{
This function takes a modelbuilder model and model settings.
It runs the simulation determined by the model settings and returns simulation results.
}
\details{
This function runs a modelbuilder model for specific settings.
