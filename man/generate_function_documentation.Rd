\description{
The model needs to adhere to the structure specified by the modelbuilder package.
Models built using the modelbuilder package automatically have the right structure.
A user can also build a model list structure themselves following the modelbuilder specifications.
If the user provides a file name, this file needs to be an Rds file
and contain a valid modelbuilder model structure.
}

This function takes as input a modelbuilder model and writes code
that produces the header part used in the functions that create model code
}
