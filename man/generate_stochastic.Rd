\title{Create a stochastic compartmental simulation model}
\usage{
generate_stochastic(mbmodel, location = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mbmodel}{a modelbuilder model structure, either as list object or file name}

\item{location}{a filename and path to save the simulation code to. Default is current directory}
}
\value{
The function does not return anything
Instead, it writes an R file into the specified directory
the name of the file is simulate_model$title_adaptivetau.R
}
\description{
The model needs to adhere to the structure specified by the modelbuilder package
models built using the modelbuilder package automatically have the right structure
a user can also build a model list structure themselves following the specifications
if the user provides an file name, this file needs to contain an object called 'model'
and contain a valid modelbuilder model structure
}
\details{
This function takes as input a modelbuilder model and writes code
for a stochastic simulator function implemented with adaptivetau
