# To-do and ideas for modelbuilder package

# Feedback to look into

Because the program requires all of the boxes to be filled working it is not possible to save in the middle of your work. If I needed to step away from the computer while in the middle of implementing them R would stop running when my computer went to sleep and I would have to start over. I could copy and paste from the page that I had started into the newly launched page but that was very time consuming and frustrating. This happened at least twice. Perhaps the program allows you to save with a warning that errors have been found but still allows you to keep your progress. 

I also received this error a couple of times when I was going to "Make the model". This means I had to close and reopen R. This might be a problem on my end with R though.

## Code Improvements
* Continue implementing unit tests using the testthat package

## Content Improvement
* Integrate with Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), do import/export to SBML 
* update model check/parse function to allow more flexible models (e.g. sin/cos/etc.)
* Add model checks to make sure user doesn't do something detrimental
* fix/finish function that creates diagrams
* Add a repository for user contributed models to package/github site. Should allow easy upload of a model (rds) file, then automated checking of model and if model is ok, automatic addition to 'database' of models. might want to do that through a shiny app? 
* Test everything, fix bugs
* Work on figure generating code

## Build features to implement
* Allowing for starting values that depend on model parameters is a feature that still needs to be implemented.
* Allowing for time-dependent parameters.
* Allowing for parameters that change on/off at discrete times.

## Advertisement
* Add a repository for user contributed models to package/github site
* Write paper to introduce package
* Find all UGA classes/instructors who could use package.
* Make instructional videos for package
* Send annoucements at suitable times
* Create more docs (tutorials/vignettes)

## General thoughts and comments
* Look into EpiModel::comp_plot() for making flow diagrams 
* look into R consortium package certification
* Get best practices badge: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en
* Maybe submit for Ropensci review: https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding
* Hashtags on twitter when promoting app: #rstats, #dynamicalsystems * Contribute code to Epirecipes? http://epirecip.es/
* develop a 'modelverse' set of packages that allow development/analysis and fitting of compartmental models without coding
* Create a website/repository of modelbuilder models that others can contribute to and download from (Like NetLogo models)
