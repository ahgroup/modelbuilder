#' Coronavirus_vaccine_model_v2_risk_age
#' 
#' @description A model with 7 compartments
#' 
#' @details The model includes susceptible, presymptomatic, asymptomatic, infected/symptomatic/ill, recovered, hospitalized, and deceased compartments. The processes that are modeled are infection, progression to infectiousness, recovery, and progression to hospitalization and death. Immunity is permanent. Demographics through natural births and deaths are not included.
#' 
#' This code was generated by the modelbuilder R package.  
#' The model is implemented as a set of ordinary differential equations using the deSolve package. 
#' The following R packages need to be loaded for the function to work: deSolve.
