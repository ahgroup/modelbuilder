#' 
#' @description A Covid vaccine model
#' 
#' @details The model includes susceptible, presymptomatic, asymptomatic, infected/symptomatic/ill, recovered, and deceased compartments.
#' 
#' This code was generated by the modelbuilder R package.  
#' The model is implemented as a set of ordinary differential equations using the deSolve package. 
#' The following R packages need to be loaded for the function to work: deSolve. 
#'

#' Values for model times : numeric 
#' @param tstart : Start time of simulation : numeric
#' @param tfinal : Final time of simulation : numeric
#' @param dt : Time step : numeric
#' @return The function returns the output as a list. 
#' The time-series from the simulation is returned as a dataframe saved as list element \code{ts}. 
#' The \code{ts} dataframe has one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.   
#' @examples  
#' # To run the simulation with default parameters:  
#' result <- simulate_COVAX1_vaccine_ode() 
#' # To choose values other than the standard one, specify them like this:  
#' result <- simulate_COVAX1_vaccine_ode(Suv = 2000,Sv = 2000,Puv = 2,Pv = 2,Auv = 2,Av = 2,Iuv = 2,Iv = 2,Ruv = 0,Rv = 0,Duv = 0,Dv = 0) 
#' # You can display or further process the result, like this:  
#' plot(result$ts[,'time'],result$ts[,'Suv'],xlab='Time',ylab='Numbers',type='l') 
#' print(paste('Max number of Suv: ',max(result$ts[,'Suv']))) 
#' @section Warning: This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do something nonsensical (e.g. have negative values for parameters), the code will likely abort with an error message.
